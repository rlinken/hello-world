# hello-world

My name is Adam.  I'm learning code as a hobby, and also a way to better understand what programmers do for me within my business at I Love Basketball, LLC.  ILB is a world leading digital basketball training company.  I'm hoping to learn, collabarated, and build a vision for my business based on what I learn and discover through this community.
